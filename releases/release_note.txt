--------------------------------
putty6.0_nd1.11
--------------------------------
1. Other changes
    1. make it possible to change the tab title dynamically. How to do:
       a. un-tick setting Terminal->Featrues->Disable remote-controlled tab title...
       b. run cmd:PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;the_tab_title\007"'. The tab title can contain the system env, for example:
           PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOST}: ${PWD}\007"'
    2. a very good idea from Lokesh: One click logging feature to capture terminal prints. This modified code will have an option for capturing the onscreen prints to a log file. Even though this is already a feature of Putty in "logging" section but there is no straight forward mechanism to Start & Stop whenever required. So two options have been provided:
       a. A menu entry "Start Logging" when we right click anywhere inside terminal (for this to work "Selection" behaviour has to be "windows").
       b. A toolbar button ">" for Start & Stop Logging.
    3. more options for log file's name(&S for session name, and &P for the desktop path).
